# Advent of Code themes
Themes for Stylus for the Advent of Code website.

Themes are based on AoC themes by [caderek AKA u/kap89 on Reddit](https://github.com/caderek/aoc2022/) [(Reddit Post)](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/zartec/more_readable_user_styles_for_aoc_website_light/) - only things changed were color and code font (from Source Code Pro to JetBrains Mono).
